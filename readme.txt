ASSIGNMENT TOPIC: Produce a Python application (UI Interface + module of figures) to generate Turtle fractals. The interface must have some UI elements to select the figure to draw and to select some of its features like length, order, angles etc. The figure module must have at least 10 turtle figuresfrom which alteast two figures should be personal and one circular.

-What I have done for this assignment?

1. A total of 14 figures can be generated namely [Binary Tree, Dandelion, Fern, SnowFlake, AntiFlake, Sierpinski Triangle, Sierpinsky Carpet, Pentagon, C-Curve, Spiral, Square Spiral, Star, Sun and an Indian Flag].

2. The application window is divided into 3 parts, Canvas being the first one on which the figures will be generated/drawn, a control panel which have some UI elements/widgets to specify the length and the order for the figures to be drawn as well as widgets to select the figures, canvas background color, pen color, pen-speed and turtle pen shape. 

3. The method to create a figure is pretty straighforward but just to make sure the UI is smoothly working, a step-by-step instruction box / UI panel is given.

4. The UI panel have a vertical scrollbar attached to its right side.

5. A number of colors could have been added to the background color optionmenu, but only few specific colors are given, as they complement the background color of the window and the overall user interface looks better.

6. Personal Figures (Which were not done in the class) = Sierpinsky Carpet, Pentagon, Spiral, Square Spiral Star, Sun and the Indian Flag.
